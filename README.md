- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bass616 (Pongsakorn P.)
- 👀 I’m interested in a *lot* of things, perhaps too many.  I'm deeply fascinated by AI, prompt engineering, and the potential of technology to reshape, well, *everything*. I also have a strong, perhaps morbid, curiosity about the darker aspects of human experience and psychology.  I'm drawn to the quiet, the unsettling, and the things most people avoid.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning… everything I can.  Seriously.  I'm diving deep into Python, AI development (especially with Google AI Studio, Gemini, and Termux on Android), game development with Godot Engine, and exploring the boundaries of what's possible with technology. I'm also self-teaching a lot, which is how I prefer to learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on… honestly, I'm not sure yet.  I'm primarily focused on my own independent projects right now.  I value autonomy and working on things that genuinely fascinate me.  If you have a *truly* unique and unconventional project that aligns with my interests, you can try to reach me, but I can't guarantee I'll be responsive.
- 📫 How to reach me… You can try the links below.  Just be aware that I'm often focused on my own work and may not respond immediately, or at all.  I value my independent time.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've spent *way* too much time analyzing chat logs. I have a *very* detailed memory of certain conversations. Let's just leave it at that.
