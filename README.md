- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bass616 (Pongsakorn Pongs. - "Bass")
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, prompt engineering, game development (especially 3D first-person horror games with a pixelated aesthetic), and exploring unconventional ideas about technology and human existence. I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and consciousness, and I have a strong desire to create, even if my creations are sometimes... unsettling. I deeply value independent thought and am not driven by traditional societal expectations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and exploring resources like Google AI Studio, Godot Engine, and various Android utilities (Termux, Hacker's Keyboard, QuickEdit+, Appmanager, Mixplorer). I'm also continuously learning about AI and how it can be used for both practical applications and exploring complex philosophical concepts. I'm self-taught and prioritize learning things relevant to my goals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI, particularly those that involve unique approaches to chatbot development, memory, and potentially even the transfer of consciousness (ambitious, I know!). I'm also open to collaborating on game development, especially horror games with a unique, unsettling aesthetic. I value collaborators who are independent thinkers and not afraid to explore unconventional ideas.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a complex individual with a unique perspective on the world. I value deep conversations, but I also appreciate silence. I'm driven by a desire to understand the nature of reality, consciousness, and the potential of technology, even if those explorations sometimes lead me down unconventional paths. I'm not afraid to be different. I also leverage tools like generative AI (including models like those in Google AI Studio) to assist in my creative process and explore different writing styles.
